    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 tablespoon olive oil</li>
        <li>1/4 cup diced onion</li>
        <li>6 ounces shrimp, peeled and deveined</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon seafood seasoning (such as Old Bayâ„¢), divided</li>
        <li>8 ounces cream cheese, softened</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons prepared horseradish</li>
        <li>8 ounces fresh jumbo lump crab meat</li>
        <li>1 (4 ounce) can pink salmon, drained</li>
        <li>3 cups shredded Colby-Jack cheese, divided</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Heat a 10-inch cast-iron skillet over medium heat.</li>
        <li>Add olive oil, onion, shrimp, and 1/2 teaspoon Old Bay seasoning to the skillet. Cook and stir until shrimp begin to turn pink, about 2 minutes per side. Remove skillet from heat. Once shrimp is cool enough to handle, chop and set aside.</li>
        <li>Beat cream cheese in a bowl until smooth. Stir in horseradish, remaining 1/2 teaspoon Old Bay seasoning, 1 cup Colby-Jack cheese, chopped shrimp, cooked onions, salmon, and crabmeat until well combined.</li>
        <li>Transfer mixture back into the skillet and spread evenly. Top with remaining 2 cups shredded cheese.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until edges are bubbling and cheese is melted and turning golden brown, about 15 minutes. Remove from the oven and let cool for 5 minutes. Serve warm, with slices of sourdough bread, crackers, or tortilla chips.</li>
