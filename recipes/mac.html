    <p>This crawfish mac and cheese, made with crawfish tails, 3 cheeses, and macaroni—or your favorite pasta—is a simple twist on tradition and a definite crowd pleaser. It’s cheesy, creamy, and full of flavor.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 pound macaroni pasta, or your favorite pasta</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons butter, divided</li>
        <li>1/2 yellow onion, chopped</li>
        <li>1 pound crawfish tail meat</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons seafood seasoning, divided, plus more to taste</li>
        <li>2 cups heavy cream</li>
        <li>8 ounces havarti cheese, shredded</li>
        <li>8 ounces cream cheese</li>
        <li>4 ounces Gouda cheese, shredded</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook elbow macaroni in the boiling water, stirring occasionally, until tender yet firm to the bite, about 8 minutes. Drain; set aside.</li>
        <li>Meanwhile, melt 2 tablespoons butter over medium heat in a saucepan. Add onions and cook and stir for 2 to 3 minutes. Add crawfish tails and 1 teaspoon seafood seasoning, and sauté for 2 minutes more. Remove from heat. Seat aside.</li>
        <li>Warm 1 cup heavy cream and 1 tablespoon butter in a saucepan over low heat. Add havarti, cream cheese, and Gouda, and melt slowly, stirring constantly. Gradually add the remaining 1 cup heavy cream, stirring constantly. Add remaining 1 teaspoon seafood seasoning; continue stirring until all cheese is melted and sauce is smooth.</li>
        <li>Mix pasta, crawfish mixture, and cheese sauce together in a large bowl or pot. Season to taste with salt, pepper, and seafood seasoning.</li>
    </ol>
